Introduction

  *Flask-Report* is a flask plugin to display a list of records in web pages,
these list of records simply are query results. It is not a RAD tool like BIRT, 
you must write configurations to generate report. And it is not versatile as
other report engines. It is meant to be simple, easy to extend/re-develop (once
you understand it).
